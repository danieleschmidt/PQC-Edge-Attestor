# Contributing to PQC-Edge-Attestor

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the PQC-Edge-Attestor project! This framework is critical for securing IoT infrastructure against quantum threats.

## Security First Development

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: This project implements cryptographic security for critical infrastructure. All contributions must undergo rigorous security review.**

### Security Guidelines

1. **No Security Vulnerabilities**: Never introduce code that could compromise device security
2. **Constant-Time Operations**: All cryptographic operations must be constant-time to prevent side-channel attacks
3. **Memory Safety**: Prevent buffer overflows, use-after-free, and other memory safety issues
4. **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs, especially from untrusted sources
5. **Secrets Management**: Never commit private keys, passwords, or sensitive configuration

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- ARM GNU Toolchain 12.2+
- CMake 3.25+
- Python 3.9+ (for tools and testing)
- Node.js 18+ (for backend services)
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Coding Standards

### C/C++ (Embedded Code)

```c
// Use secure coding practices
void secure_memzero(void *ptr, size_t len) {
    volatile uint8_t *p = ptr;
    while (len--) *p++ = 0;
}

// Constant-time comparison
int secure_compare(const uint8_t *a, const uint8_t *b, size_t len) {
    uint8_t result = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        result |= a[i] ^ b[i];
    }
    return result == 0 ? 0 : -1;
}
```

### JavaScript/Node.js (Backend Services)

```javascript
// Use async/await with proper error handling
async function verifyAttestation(report) {
    try {
        validateInput(report);
        const result = await crypto.verify(report);
        return result;
    } catch (error) {
        logger.error('Attestation verification failed', { error, reportId: report.id });
        throw new AttestationError('Verification failed');
    }
}
```

### Documentation Standards

- All public APIs must have JSDoc/Doxygen comments
- Include usage examples for complex functions
- Document security considerations
- Explain cryptographic parameters and choices

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Run unit tests for crypto functions
npm run test:crypto

# Test specific algorithms
npm run test:kyber
npm run test:dilithium
npm run test:falcon
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Hardware-in-loop testing
npm run test:hil

# End-to-end attestation flow
npm run test:e2e
```

### Security Testing
```bash
# Side-channel analysis
npm run test:sidechannel

# Fuzzing tests
npm run test:fuzz

# Static analysis
npm run test:static
```

## Code Review Process

### Automated Checks
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚úÖ Code coverage > 90%
- ‚úÖ No security vulnerabilities detected
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks within limits
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated

### Security Review Requirements

**For Cryptographic Code:**
- Two independent security engineer reviews
- Side-channel analysis report
- Formal verification (where applicable)
- Comparison against reference implementations

**For Critical Infrastructure Code:**
- Security architect approval
- Threat model review
- Failure mode analysis

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

Use the bug report template and include:
- Device information (hardware, firmware version)
